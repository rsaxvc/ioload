1. Introduction
   ------------

This is version 0.7.3 of nload, a console application which monitors network
traffic and bandwidth usage in real time.
It visualizes the in- and outgoing traffic using two graphs and provides
additional info like total amount of transfered data and min/max network
usage.

2. Installing / Compiling nload
   ----------------------------

Compiling is done by running

./configure
make

in the directory where this README is.
To install nload, you have to be root:

su
make install

You can find more detailed information in the file INSTALL in this directory.

3. Using nload
   -----------

To learn about the command line switches and the usage of nload in general,
simply run:

Alternatively, there is a nload man page available by typing:

4. Uninstalling nload
