1. Introduction
   ------------

This is version 0.7.3 of ioload, a console application which monitors disk
traffic and bandwidth usage in real time.
It visualizes the in- and outgoing traffic using two graphs and provides
additional info like total amount of transfered data and min/max disk
usage.

2. Installing / Compiling ioload
   ----------------------------

Compiling is done by running

./configure
make

in the directory where this README is.
To install ioload, you have to be root:

su
make install

You can find more detailed information in the file INSTALL in this directory.

3. Using ioload
   -----------

To learn about the command line switches and the usage of ioload in general,
simply run:

ioload --help

Alternatively, there is a ioload man page available by typing:

man ioload

4. Uninstalling ioload
   ------------------

If you want to uninstall ioload (I hope you never want to ;-), run:

make uninstall

in the build directory.
